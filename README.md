# Project Title

ExpenseKeeper

## Goal

Keep spending some time on DIY project after work or part-time, it can be worked as a good playground to practice the latest skills and improve my existing skills. Any comments, suggestions, and contributions are very well welcomed! :) 

Done:
</br>1) Material Design + Costume Views + Material Animation(RecyclerView, CardView, Spinner, Drawer, FloatingActionButton, ExplosionView, PageCurl, Behavior Programming, Fragment Transition, Object Animation and so on).
</br>2) Performance Enhanced (No memory leak, no GC triggered, APK size under 3MB, coldStart inside 1s, Smooth user experience).

ToDo:
</br>1) Using Nodejs build Restful Api.
</br>2) Build up a Recipt scanner by extending Zxing library so that user could scan recipt to record the expense instead of inputting   numbers.
</br>3) Setup the Disk/MemoryLruCache and MongoDB.
</br>4) Immigrate the Native App to Hybrid by using ReactNative.
</br>5) Customerize Icons and Action Listener.
